# gdax-orderbook-ml
Application of machine learning to the GDAX orderbook using a stacked bidirectional LSTM/GRU model to predict new support and resistance on a 15-minute basis; Currently under heavy development.

## Project/File Structure

Latest notebook file(s) with project code:

**8_program_structure_improvement.ipynb**:
- Even further refinement to program structure
    - Function scope and structure & function creation for common operations
    - Parsing of raw data into 4 seperate l2 update (4 consecutive 15 minute l2update segements)
- Machine learning model refinement & training + model structure updates
- Refinement of data storage format/file type 
    - Researching/testing implementations to move away from .csv due to file I/O limitations:
        - Research into Pickle/h5py/msgpack/feather to saving dataframe contents to disk is underway
- *Currently broken*:
    - API calls from the gdax-python API for candlestick data for the first timestamp of each l2update_15min file (1 hour of l2 updates split into four 15-minute increments) currently not working
    - Implementation of historical candlestick/OHLC data from 'gdax-ohlc-import' work in progress

**6_raw_dataset_update.ipynb**:
- Update to raw_data (raw_data scrape in both MongoDB and csv format, 1 hour of websocket data from GDAX)
    - L2 Snapshot + L2 Updates without overhead of Match data response (does not have Match data; test data  which does have Match data and adds I/O overhead)
        
### Folder/Repository Structure:  

- *'gdax-python' and 'gdax-ohlc-import' are repositories imported as Git Submodules*

- 'model_saved' folder:
    - Contains .json and .h5 files for Tensorflow/Keras models (trained model and model weight export/import)

- 'documentation' folder: 
    - 'design_mockup' folder: 
        - Contains diagrams, drawings, and notes used in the process of model and project design during prototyping, testing, and expansion.
    - 'design_explanation' folder:
        - Contains 8 pages of detailed explanations and diagrams in regards to both project/model structure and design.

- 'saved_charts' folder:
    - Output of generate_chart() for candlestick chart with visualized autogenerated support and resistance from autoSR()
    - Screenshot of model layer structure in text format
    - Graphviz output of model layer structure

- 'test_data' folder: 
    - Only has 10 minutes of scraped data for testing, development, and model input prototyping (snapshot + l2 response updates)

- 'raw_data' folder: 
    - 1 hour of scraped data (snapshot + l2 response updates)
        - l2update_15min_1-4: 1 hour of l2 updates split into four 15-minute increments
        - mongo_raw.json: 1 hour of scraped data from the gdax-python API websocket in raw mongoDB format
        
- 'raw_data_10h' folder: 
    - 10 hours of scraped data: 
        - l2update_10h, request_log_10h, and snapshot_asks/bids_10h 
        - 10 hours of scraped data in raw mongoDB export (JSON): mongo_raw_10h.json
    - Data in .msg (MessagePack) format currently experiemental/testing as alternative to .csv format for I/O operations

- 'archived_ipynb' folder: 
    - Contains previous Jupyter Notebook files used in the construction, design, and prototyping of components of this project.
        - Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) notebook files 1-5 & 7
        - Each sucessive notebook was used to construct and test whether at each "stage" if a project of this kind of scope would even be technically possible. 
    - Successive numbered notebooks generally improve and are iterative in nature on previous notebook files for this project.*
